Hey ðŸ‘‹

â€‹

It's Per from Scrimba here. As you might know, we're launching a Frontend Developer Career Path soon (click here to join the waitlist). In it, you'll get tons of challenges. And this week, we'd like to share some of them with you, in the form of a free, email-based JavaScript course.

â€‹

This course is also a sequel to the previous 7-day JavaScript challenge we launched a few weeks ago. Over 8.000 people enrolled in that one, so it was a huge success. Those who enroll will get a JavaScript challenge in their inbox every day for ten days, with answers the following day - all created by the eminent Dylan Israel ðŸ”¥

ðŸ‘‰ Click here to enroll & watch the first challenge!

ðŸ‘† Clicking the link will enroll you in the course automatically. No extra action required ðŸ‘†

â€‹

The challenges assume that you have a basic understanding of JavaScript. If you're not quite there yet, try our free Introduction to JavaScript course to get you up to speed.

Coming soon: The Frontend Developer Career Path (ðŸ‘ˆ click to join the waitlist)
