Hi fellow coder 👋

​

How did it go yesterday? Did you manage to solve the third coding challenge? If so, feel free to share your solution in the #share-your-code channel in our community Discord.

​

If you didn't solve it, no worries, you shouldn't feel bad! Struggling with something just means that you're learning and pushing yourself to the limit. Here's Dylan's solution to the challenge, so be sure to check it out.

​

Just a reminder: The Frontend Developer Career Path 🛣

​Day 4: Array Replace​

​

If you feel you're lacking the JavaScript skills needed to solve these challenges, you can check out Dylan's free Intro to JavaScript and Intro to ES6 courses first. And if those aren't enough, we also have a full-blown JavaScript bootcamp.​

​

Best of luck 😁
