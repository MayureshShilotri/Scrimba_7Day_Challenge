### Day 2: Create a Navbar - The 7-Day CSS Challenge

Hi fellow coder üëã
Welcome to the 7-day CSS challenge!

Every day for the next week, you'll get a CSS challenge right here in your inbox. The challenges have been created by Jad Khalili and will be presented as Scrimba screencasts, meaning you can solve them directly in the browser. The following day, you'll get Jad's suggested solution, along with the next challenge.

To get to the first challenge, click the link belowüëá

Day 1: Improve this site

In this challenge, you'll get a basic HTML skeleton along with a design you're going implement. It's pretty simple, as we want to start off easy, and then ramp up the level throughout the week.

If you manage to solve the challenge, feel free to share your solution in the #share-your-code channel in our community Discord. However, there is no need to reply to this email with your solution, as I don't have time to look at all of the solutions our students create.


If you feel you're lacking the CSS skills needed to solve these challenges, you should consider enrolling in The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp on Scrimba. It'll enable you to write CSS at a professional level.

Best of luck üòÅ

PS: If you want to unroll from this 7-day CSS course, you can click here, and you won't receive any more CSS challenges. You'll still be on Scrimba's general newsletter, so if you'd like to stop receiving emails from us entirely, simply click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of this email.
