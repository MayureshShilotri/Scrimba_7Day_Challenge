### Introduction - CSS Challenge 6 - Animated One-Page Site

Jad Khalili
Challenge:

Your goal is to animate a one-page side, gradually bringing in all the components of the page using animations. At first, the header should slide and fade in from the left, followed by the hero section scaling up, the about us section expanding and fading in from the top, and finally, the footer section expanding and fading in from the left. There should be some delay between the animations, but they should still overlap for the most part. The page elements shouldn't be seen until their animations are played. Good luck!

Hints:

Use animations
Think of the animation properties!
