# Scrimba_7Day_Challenge

Hey 👋

It's Per from Scrimba here. This week, we're offering you a free email-based JavaScript course.

Those who enroll in it will get a JavaScript challenge in their inbox every day for a week. All created by the eminent Dylan Israel 🔥

To enroll, simply click the link below 👇

​Click here to enroll & watch the first challenge!​

The challenges assume that you have basic understanding of JavaScript, and that you know concepts like arrays, strings, functions, conditionals, and loops.

If you're not fully there yet, you can check out Dylan's free Intro to JavaScript and Intro to ES6 courses first. And if those aren't enough, we also have a full-blown JavaScript bootcamp.

Share the challenge!
If you'd like to share this challenge with someone, you can send them a link to this landing page, so that they can sign up for themselves: https://jschallenge.scrimba.com​

Best of luck 😁
